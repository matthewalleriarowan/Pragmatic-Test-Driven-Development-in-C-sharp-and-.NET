This is a project based on the book "Pragmatic Test-Driven Development in C# and .Net" by Adam Tibi.

This is from Chapter 02 of the book. Some sections of the code are adapted or used as posted by GitHub user: oleg-glushko. Thank you for posting a resolution to the issue of the API changing authorization (401) access to certain functionality.

I am using this repo as part of a portfolio and platform for learning more about various
technologies. This project is built in Visual Studio Community 2022.
